# Project 1
In this project, I created a private blockchain to record ownership of stars. Built as an express.js app, I implemented the code in src/block.js and src/blockchain.js that provides the functionality of validating a block on the blockchain, decoding the block, and constructing a chain of blocks that can be signed with an Electrum wallet. The project also exposes endpoints to search for blocks by block height, block hash, and by the address of the wallet that signed the block.
